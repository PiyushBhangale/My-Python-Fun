Maze
====

Simple maze generator in Python. Can be used as a library to generate and
modify mazes, or run from the command line to play as a game.

When using as a game, the goal is to move `@`, using the arrow keys, to the
goal `$`.

Usage:
- `python maze.py` (uses default size of 50x50)
- `python maze.py 40 15` (specify size 40x15)
- `python maze.py 20` (square maze 20x20)
